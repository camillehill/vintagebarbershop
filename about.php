<h2>Our Story</h2>
<div class="ourstory" id="ourstory_1stparagraph">
  <p>Since May 2008, we've helped countless customers look their best. Whether you're getting ready for an interview, going on a date, or just in need of a trim, we have the skills and experience to help you look like a million bucks.</p>

  <br>

  <p>We opened Vintage Barbershop with a mission to offer a classy, premium barber shop experience to the people of Mansfield. When we first opened, we didn't even have a sign - just a big balloon with "Barbershop" written on it.</p>

  <br>

  <p>We weren't experts about running a business, but we were obsessed with providing the best barber shop experience in Mansfield.</p>

  <br>

  <p>Over a decade later, we're still just as passionate about helping you look your best.</p>
